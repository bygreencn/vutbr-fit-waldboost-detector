- bindless texture version is generally faster than the single texture version
possibly due to the fact, that texture is read-optimized and single texture version
uses both reads and writes

- pyramid generation is faster on gtx780ti, whereas detection is faster on gtx980
gtx800 has higher frequency, but less streaming processors (compute cores)

- 8x8 blocks are the fastest for pyramid image generation, where as 16x16 blocks are the fastest for detection

- detection for gtx580 and 32x32 blocks (fermi architecture) is dramatically slower then with other block sizes or GPUs
it has only 512 streaming processors, 32x32 block size is optimal for GPUs with 1024+ SMs
